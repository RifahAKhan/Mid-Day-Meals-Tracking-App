As is well known, the 9.12 crore underprivileged children do not receive the recommended amount of nutrients from
their midday meals. The government created the PM Poshan Scheme to solve this issue by guaranteeing that every
youngster receives one hot meal each day. However, there are numerous scams going on as a result of the middlemen engaged.
Therefore, this app was created with the following workflow to address the issue.

## Objectives:
1. The middlemen-related scams in providing mid-day meals would be eliminated by this software.
2. This software is unique since no other app has been developed with the right functionality to aid in tracking mid-day meals.
3. The third factor is that the children will be given a variety of help line numbers so they may report any form of abuse or
other concerns directly.
4. This software could end student malnutrition and provide the underprivileged youngsters with the
daily nutrients they need.

## Tech Stack:
1. Firebase
2. Tensorflow
3. Java
4. XML

## Workflow:
The workflow using the tech stack is as follows:
1. The Higher Authorities would register every school in a certain area and give each one a special ID and password.
2. A login and registration interface would be provided to the schools with Firebase as the authentication provider.
3. The school can then register all the kids of different classes that would be stored to keep a track on
the students who've used the software.
4. There would be two main elements on the home page: The first one is uploading the image of children having
the mid-day meal and the other would be student feedback for the mid-day meals provided.
Both would be collected on a daily basis from the schools and from a large number of students.
5. Every school's monthly average would be taken into consideration based on the responses and automatically forwarded
to the authorities that would be implemented using a general rule based approach to confirm if the government school
is providing meals in the right way
6. The children will also be given a variety of help line numbers so they may report any form of abuse or other concerns
directly.
